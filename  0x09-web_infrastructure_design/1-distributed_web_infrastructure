Components Explanation
1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
Purpose: Distributes traffic across multiple servers

Algorithm: Round Robin (default)

Rotates requests evenly between servers

Simple and effective for most cases

Setup: Active-Active

Both web servers handle traffic simultaneously

More efficient than Active-Passive where backup servers sit idle

2. Web Servers (Nginx x2)
Role:

Handle HTTP/HTTPS requests

Serve static content

Reverse proxy to application servers

Redundancy: Two servers prevent single point of failure

3. Application Servers (x2)
Function:

Execute application code

Process business logic

Interface with database

Sync: Both run identical codebase

4. Database Cluster (Primary-Replica)
Primary Node:

Handles all write operations

Pushes changes to replica

Replica Node:

Handles read operations

Provides failover capability

Sync Method: Asynchronous replication

Infrastructure Issues
1. Single Points of Failure
Load Balancer (HAProxy)

Primary Database node

No redundant load balancer

2. Security Concerns
No firewall implementation

No HTTPS encryption

No intrusion detection system

3. Monitoring Gaps
No server health monitoring

No traffic analytics

No alert system for failures

4. Performance Limitations
Only two application servers

Single database write node

No caching layer

Improvement Recommendations
High Availability:

Add backup load balancer (Active-Passive)

Implement database failover

Security:

Configure firewalls (UFW/iptables)

Implement SSL/TLS encryption

Set up SSH key authentication

Monitoring:

Add Prometheus + Grafana

Configure log aggregation

Set up alert notifications

Performance:

Add caching (Redis/Memcached)

Implement database read replicas

Consider auto-scaling

Communication Flow
User requests www.foobar.com

DNS resolves to load balancer IP

HAProxy routes request to available web server

Nginx processes request (static) or proxies to app server

App server queries appropriate database node

Response travels back through the chain
